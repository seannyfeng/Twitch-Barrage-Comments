1. make the pop-up more compact so it doesn't take too much space and people don't have to scroll down. 
2. can consider assigning the same color to the same user just in case people want to have some short conversation. 
3. clip function can be added in the future to include the barrage in the clip.
4. can add a setting to constrain the barrage to a certain area on the screen.
5. sometimes the barrage don't show up when opening a new page.
